## Development

- The visualizer runs entirely client-side using the Web Audio API and Canvas 2D.
- Each mode (spectrum, waveform, spectrogram) is drawn on a per-frame loop using requestAnimationFrame.
- Communication with the active tab uses `chrome.tabCapture`.

### Adding new modes

- Declare a new entry in the `MODE_REGISTRY` object inside [`visualizer.js`](source/visualizer.js).
- Implement the `{ setup, draw, cleanup }` interface: use `setup` to prepare audio nodes/data and return state, `draw` to start the animation loop, and optionally `cleanup` to tear down listeners or node connections.
- Add the mode key to the registry in the order you want it to appearâ€”`startMode` automatically reads from the registry so no other wiring is required.
